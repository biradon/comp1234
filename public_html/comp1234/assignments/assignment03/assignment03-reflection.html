        During the assignment, I was able to practice how to use prompt to get user input and then assign that input to an existing variable. This allowed me to explore how JavaScript handles different types of data, including strings and numbers, and how to manipulate those data types in a program.

I also learned the importance of validating user input to ensure that the data entered meets specific criteria. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including conditional statements and regular expressions.

Overall, the assignment helped me to gain a better understanding of how prompt works and how it can be used to get user input in JavaScript. I also learned the importance of validating user input and how to assign input to existing variables. These skills will be invaluable as I continue to build my proficiency in JavaScript and develop more complex programs in the future.
