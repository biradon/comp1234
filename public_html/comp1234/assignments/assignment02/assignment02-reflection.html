    <h1>
        My reflection about Assignment 2
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        This assignment helps me understand about box model and I'm thankful that now I can confidently build the whole landing page for myself.<br>
I like the way that we build from zero to become a completed website and I can show my friends and family what I can do<br>
One of the most challenges for me is the selector and details oriented. Because I have to manage all of the class id names and it needs to be consistent to make sure that I know how my code is going on. Most of the time I need to prepare the document to make sure I know what I am doing with my code. I'm curious about the group project and how we can interact with other developers to make 1 project. I hope the school professors could give us advice on how to work with each other.<br>
The other challenge for me is the box model. I know how it works, but applying it smoothly is a totally different story. The first time I'm confusing between padding and margin, is there any difference and how could I know in this case I will use padding, In this case, I need to use padding.<br>
Currently, I'm also building a website of my own, it is a web application to manage personal financial and my tech stack will be HTML CSS Javascript MongoDB after that I can apply a modern backend-side like Python or Go. I'm excited to build something from my own and looking forward to learning new things.
