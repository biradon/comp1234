    <h1>
        My reflection about Assignment 1
    </h1>
    <p>
        Firstly I want to say thank you to my professor in the COMP1234 course, I knew HTML before but while studying in their class I deeply understood what I'm able to do in my HTML file.
        During the time I'm trying to complete Assignment 01, I was faced with many challenges related to putting the same direction from my local file to my server file. It was pretty tricky if you do not have a well understanding of the absolute path and relative path, I think it will help me a lot in my future career. Other things were not hard for me so I'm quite confident that I'm making them correctly. I intended to make my list more beautiful by adding some styles the professor used to teach us in class, but it's not included in the requirement so I will make it in the next assignment.
        My method of troubleshooting is using my local HTML to check the external link, and I used gblearn hosting to check the absolute and root-relative paths. Currently, we did not build any testing environment yet, so the only way to test it is on the production environment which is gblearn website. I tried to transfer the file several times to make sure everything is working correctly the same as assignment 01's instruction. I used HTML validator from javascript code to check my HTML file validation also.
        Once again thank you for everything and I'm looking forward to learning about CSS and JavaScript to build a complete website. 
    </p>
